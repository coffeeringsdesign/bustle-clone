Amid the downpour soaking the set (the historic Pullman Yards, a former munitions factory on Atlanta’s east side), Monáe approaches the camera poised, focused. She kicks off the boots and climbs atop a small tower of crates; she summits and smiles.

"Fans have to patiently hang tight for nearly a year until Stranger Things 3 premieres in summer 2019. While the wait seems super long, there is a silver lining. Halloween is around the corner and there are plenty of Stranger Things group costume ideas that will allow you to channel the show and make the wait feel a bit more bearable. Whether lurking in the Upside Down or experiencing the mystery in Hawkins, get your crew and be ready to fight off demogorgons. (Or better yet, be a demogorgon.)One of the greatest things about Stranger Things is its array of characters, and their groups, for fans to cheer on and identify with. There's of course Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), and their tight-knit gang. But there are also the teens like babysitter Steve (Joe Keery) and Hawkins' newest bad boy Billy (Dacre Montgomery). If you're into channeling the older crowd, there's the fan-favorite character Hopper (David Harbour) and the always stressed yet beloved Joyce (Winona Ryder)."
